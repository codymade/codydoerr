## Portfolio Work  
[Hologuardians](https://codymade.itch.io/hologuardians) - A Jam Game with the Theme 'It is Not Real'  
>A top down shooter where you utilize copies of yourself to dodge bullets, destroy shields and enemies, and solve platforming puzzles  
>I was the programmer for all portions of this project along with UI design and setting up the Prefabs within Unity for the level designer to put them together into a game.  

[Plunder the Present](https://isu-game-dev-club.itch.io/plunder-the-present) - A game produced in 15 weeks along with the larger group within our Game Development Club
>This 2D Side scrolling metroidvania hosted a pirate stuck in the modern day attempting to fuel his ship to leave the present  
>  
>I was an associate programmer along with a group of about 10 others working to accomplish tasks given to us by the Programming Lead. We collaborated with members of each of the 3 other teams to accomplish the goals set out by the Executives of the Club, each being a leader of the teams. I was able to heavily contribute to the development of novel scripts for many of the game's functions which lead me to creating a small team of indie developers to work on our own project in the next semester

[Thylla and the Old Gods](https://isu-game-dev-club.itch.io/thylla-and-the-old-gods) - A game also produced in 15 weeks along side a small group of indie developers in the Game Development Club
     
>A top down(0.5) Lovecraftian themed puzzle game where utilizing light helps you along the way 
>  
>I was the project lead for the full duration of this project. I spent my time developing the tasks according to the project requirements the team set up and assisting design ideas. I helped manage the scope, milestone dates, and final polishing as the project came to a close and ensured that all team members were able to collaborate to get the assets we needed to finish. I was able to contribute to the programming in many scripts made by the programmers on this team, as well as making my own for various tasks.
